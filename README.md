# Swift Compiler Error: Missing Argument Label

This example demonstrates a common Swift compiler error that occurs when calling a function with labeled parameters while omitting the label for one or more parameters.  The compiler will produce an error indicating that you've passed too few arguments, even though you've provided all the necessary values.
